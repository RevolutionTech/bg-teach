### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] 3 parts: auction, race, betting
- [ ] Objective: most money
- [ ] Game end: race finishes

### Race

- [ ] Play a card, move cars top to bottom (no redraw)
- [ ] Movement: forward or diagonal, not sideways or backwards
  - [ ] Cars can become blocked, even intentionally
- [ ] White is wild (any color not elsewhere on the card)
- [ ] Cross the finish line to place
- [ ] When all your cars have finished, discard entire hand

### Betting

- [ ] Betting occurs when first car crosses the corresponding betting line
- [ ] Can bet on any player's car
- [ ] Bets payout for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place cars

### Auction

- [ ] Cars auctioned off one at a time
  - [ ] Each is sold with a special ability
- [ ] Simultaneous auction: players select a card from hand
  - [ ] The value for the car with the matching color is their bid in $M
  - [ ] Tiebreakers: more cars, no wild symbol
- [ ] Bid winner gets: matching Speed-8 card, power card, driver plaque
  - [ ] The bid winner also notes their bid (to be subtracted from their total at game end)
- [ ] Cards used in a bid are returned to players' hands
- [ ] Each player must get at least one car, players with cars eventually get eliminated from the auction
  - [ ] Any player with multiple abilities keeps only 1

### Rare situations

- [ ] Tiebreaker: car placement
- [ ] Race: If a car doesn't finish, it doesn't place ($0M)
- [ ] Auction: If a player has no cards matching the car up for bid, they may use wild instead
- [ ] Auction: If no one bids on a car, set it aside
  - [ ] After all cars have been bid on, players without any cars bid the set aside cars
  - [ ] If any cars are still set aside, they race without anyone owning them
