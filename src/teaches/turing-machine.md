# Turing Machine

### Overview

- [ ] Background on Turing machines
- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] Objective: first to find secret code
- [ ] Game end: player correctly guesses secret code or last player standing

### Round

- [ ] Overview: make proposal, question verifiers, possibly guess secret code
- [ ] Make proposal: choose a 3-digit code, write down, take corresponding punch cards
- [ ] Question 1-3 verifiers
  - [ ] Choose a verifier
  - [ ] Compare your proposal to the verifier to determine the criterion
  - [ ] Match up the punch cards correctly
  - [ ] Check if the criterion passes or fails, mark âœ“ or x
  - [ ] If your proposal does not match any criterion, you will get an x
  - [ ] You may note other inferences (eg. what you can generalize from the verifier, what values you can eliminate)
  - [ ] Reminder: the verifier does not tell you about the code directly
  - [ ] If you question additional verifiers, use the same proposal
- [ ] Simultaneously reveal if guessing code
  - [ ] Guessers check the answer: game ends if correct, player eliminated if incorrect

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] No verifier is superfluous
- [ ] Tiebreaker: fewest questions
