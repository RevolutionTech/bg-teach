# Deadly Dowagers

### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] Objective: marry the Duke
- [ ] Game ends when a player plays a remarry card to marry the Duke

### Round overview

- [ ] Round overview: draft, invest, husband, housekeeping
- [ ] Drafting phase: closed draft 4/5 cards
  - [ ] Draft direction changes each round
- [ ] Investment/Husband phases: play cards
- [ ] Housekeeping phase: discard down to 3 cards

### Investment Phase

- [ ] Play any number of Land, Venture, and Instant cards
  - [ ] Often these have a cost of crown and/or infamy
- [ ] Lands and ventures provide investments that will pay out when husband dies (Settling of Accounts)
  - [ ] Ventures are discarded, but lands are not
- [ ] Max 4 lands, increases to 5 once marrying a noble husband
  - [ ] Can discard any card during the investment phase to make room for something else (eg. replacing a land)
- [ ] Instants are immediately discarded

### Husband Phase

- [ ] Deal with your current or future husband
- [ ] When marrying, pay the dowry
  - [ ] To marry a working class husband, increase your infamy
  - [ ] To marry a noble husband, you must meet infamy requirements
- [ ] When husband dies, +1 infamy per husband in graveyard, trigger settling of accounts, discard all ventures, and place husband in graveyard
  - [ ] -5 crowns granted during settling of accounts if infamy >= 10
- [ ] You may play a Cause of Death or Remarry card
  - [ ] Cause of Death: increase infamy to kill husband
- [ ] Then, you may play one other husband phase action: strangle, elope, or promote
  - [ ] Strangle: increase infamy by 7 to kill husband
  - [ ] Elope: increase infamy by 5 to remarry
  - [ ] Promote: pay 3/5 crowns to advance
  - [ ] Intuitively you can either kill or marry on your turn, but if you're greedy you can kill then elope or remarry then strangle to do both on the same turn

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] Tiebreakers: most money, least infamy

### Special Lands & Ventures

- [ ] Rent: play on Farmland or Estate not already rented
- [ ] Shipping: collect 3-5 to gain crowns
- [ ] Mill: bonus crowns for matching resource icons

### Setup

- [ ] Each player selects a working-class husband (pay dowry, adjust infamy)
  - [ ] If disagreement, youngest player chooses first
