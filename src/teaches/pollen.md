# Pollen

### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] Objective: collect majorities of butterflies, bees, and junebugs
- [ ] Area majority, tile placement
- [ ] Game end: last meeple of a type is taken OR last pollinator token is placed OR all players hands are empty

### Turn

- [ ] Turn overview: plant, pollinate, and attract
- [ ] Plant: place garden card with a corner touching at least 1 pollinator token
- [ ] Pollinate: score pollinator tokens completely encircled
  - [ ] Player with majority symbols wins the corresponding meeple
  - [ ] Stars count as wild
  - [ ] On a tie, no player scores
  - [ ] Some pollinator tokens contain multiple insects, both are scored separately
  - [ ] Flip the pollinator token over once scored
- [ ] Attract: fill empty pollinator spots with 2+ garden cards of different players
  - [ ] If multiple eligible spots, the active player draws more "next up" tokens and then assigns them
  - [ ] If pollinator token is already surrounded, score it immediately 

### Scoring

- [ ] Determine player with majority in each insect type
- [ ] If 1 player is leader in 2-3 types, they win
- [ ] If no players leads any type, the player with the most meeples wins
- [ ] Otherwise, players that don't lead any type lose and the player with the most meeples of other types wins
- [ ] Tiebreaker: most total scoring meeples
