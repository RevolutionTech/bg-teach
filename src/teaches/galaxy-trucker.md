# Galaxy Trucker

## First Game

### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] First build your ship (real-time), then flight (turn order)
- [ ] Objective: most cosmic credits at the end of the flight

### Build

- [ ] Take a tile and flip it over your board
- [ ] Place it, or return it faceup
- [ ] Once you take your next tile you cannot move previous tiles anymore
- [ ] Placement rules
  - [ ] Connectors must match up (no 1-pipe to 2-pipe, no connector to smooth)
  - [ ] Part must be connected to the ship
  - [ ] All sides touching must be valid
  - [ ] Exposed connectors are allowed but increase risk of damage and slow your ship down
- [ ] When finished building, move rocket to next available space on flight board
  - [ ] Being earlier in the order is higher risk, higher reward
- [ ] When all players finish, review everyone's ships and fix any problems (rearranging rocket order if necessary)

### Ship Components

- [ ] Structural modules: no effect (but more universal connectors)
  - [ ] Alien life support systems work just like structural modules
- [ ] Cabins: +2 crew
- [ ] Engines: travel faster
  - [ ] Exhaust must point to the rear
  - [ ] Space behind engine must be empty
- [ ] Cannons: shoot down meteors, most useful pointing forward
  - [ ] Space in front of cannon must be empty
- [ ] Double Engines/Cannons: work like single counterparts but have twice as much power and require batteries to be operated
- [ ] Battery components: +2-3 batteries
- [ ] Shields: Deflects small meteors and small enemy fire on two sides
  - [ ] Location doesn't matter, but orientation does
- [ ] Cargo Holds: +2-3 containers for cargo
  - [ ] Red (radioactive) cargo can only be stored in Special Cargo Holds

### Flight

- [ ] First, prepare for launch (gain astronauts and batteries)
- [ ] Draw and resolve adventure cards until deck runs out
- [ ] Turn order is typically flight order
- [ ] Losing flight days: reverse flight order, skip over other rockets
- [ ] Projectiles: small meteors (smooth sides, shields), large meteors (cannons), light cannon fire (shields), heavy cannon fire (cannot block)
  - [ ] Hit components are destroyed and placed in discard (-1 cosmic credit each)
  - [ ] Disconnected components as a result fall off and are discarded also
- [ ] Cargo: different values per color, can rearrange/discard cargo whenever gaining more
  - [ ] When losing cargo, must lose most valuable cargo
- [ ] Strength: calculate and compare to other players
  - [ ] Double engines/cannons are worth 2 only if spending a battery
  - [ ] Cannons pointing to the side or rear are worth half
- [ ] Scoring: finish order, best-looking ship, cargo sales, lost components
