# Sandbag

### Overview

- [ ] Summary: trick avoidance game with a grab bag of mechanisms
- [ ] Objective: fewest points
- [ ] Game end: 3 rounds playing all tricks
- [ ] Suits: 4/5/5/5 colors plus rockets

### Trick

- [ ] Follow standard trick-taking rules
- [ ] When winning a trick, each card is placed facedown in score pile and worth one point (bad)
- [ ] Rockets are worth negative points (good)

### Twists

- [ ] Game has 3 twists
- [ ] Twist #1: Baskets determine trump suit
  - [ ] Most of color, highest sum
  - [ ] Multiple trumps are possible
  - [ ] No trumps are possible if no balloons (to be explained)
  - [ ] Evaluate trump at end of trick
- [ ] Twist #2: Swap a card from another player's basket
  - [ ] You replace the other player's card with one of your cards facedown
  - [ ] The taken card must be played immediately
  - [ ] Your play must be valid given your hand after the swap; either:
    - [ ] You lead the trick
    - [ ] You take a rocket or a card of the lead color
    - [ ] You have no cards of the lead color
    - [ ] You have one card of the lead color and use that to swap
  - [ ] In other words, you could never take a card of a non-lead color and play it when you'd still have a card of the lead color in your hand
- [ ] Twist #3: Play sandbag to lose the trick (good)
  - [ ] Can be played even when could match lead suit
  - [ ] If sandbag lead, first player that can play a faceup card must
  - [ ] If all players play a sandbag, no one wins trick

### Scoring

- [ ] 1 point per sandbag, including basket
- [ ] -5/-5/-7/-7 points per rocket (good)
- [ ] Sum of values of faceup cards in basket (very bad)

### Setup

- [ ] Pass one card to each neighbour
- [ ] Choose two cards for your basket (want other players to take these)
- [ ] Choose one card for your sandbag
- [ ] Reveal basket cards simultaneously
- [ ] First player is player with highest trump card in their basket
  - [ ] Tiebreaker: closest to the left of the dealer

### Future Rounds

- [ ] Rounds 2 & 3: one additional sandbag per 10 points

### Minutia

- [ ] Tiebreakers: lowest score in 3rd round, 2nd round, 1st round, next player
- [ ] If multiple players tie for winning a trick, the player that played the earlier card wins
