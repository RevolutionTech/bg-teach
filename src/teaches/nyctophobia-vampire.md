# Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter

### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] Objective: two stages
  - [ ] Investigate: find the familiar
  - [ ] Escape: get them back to the car
- [ ] Game end: both stages of objective completed (hunted players win) or any hunted player loses 2 health (vampire wins)
- [ ] Hunted players cannot see the board during the game, instead relying on their sense of touch and memory to navigate

### Vampire Turn

- [ ] Play a card
- [ ] Draw back up to 2
- [ ] Movement prioritizes noise token, then closest hunted player
- [ ] Vampire never enters a space with a hunted, familiar, or the car space

### Hunted Turn

- [ ] Move 2 spaces orthogonally
  - [ ] Trees and other hunted players block movement
  - [ ] May search before and after movement
  - [ ] Pick up familiar or rocks by entering their space
- [ ] Take 1 action (before or after movement)
  - [ ] Sprint: another movement
  - [ ] Leave the familiar: in adjacent space
  - [ ] Hide: flip token, unaffected by gameplay
    - [ ] Restrictions: only after movement, only available during investigate stage
  - [ ] Throw rock: travels in a straight line until hitting something
    - [ ] Players learn how far the rock traveled and what it hit
    - [ ] A noise token is placed in the spot the rock lands
    - [ ] Can only throw a rock if you have one
    - [ ] If the rock hits another hunted player, that player loses 1 health
    - [ ] If the rock hits the vampire, the vampire is wounded
      - [ ] When wounded, vampire moves two spaces back and reduces movement to 1 space next turn

### Combat

- [ ] Combat is initiated when a player finds the vampire from searching
- [ ] Hunted loses 1 health
- [ ] Possible counter-attack with rock
- [ ] Retreat: 1-2 spaces and may hide (regardless of stage)
- [ ] Noise token removed
- [ ] Hunted turn ends immediately

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] Player turn order
  - [ ] 3-4P: H, H, (H), V, ...
  - [ ] 5P: H, H, V, H, H, V, ...
- [ ] Communication is essential: hunted players may want to divide up the area, players should describe where they are moving, what they feel around them, etc.
  - [ ] Hidden players cannot speak or they unhide and place noise token
- [ ] Character roles
- [ ] Setup: Vampire gives a single directional clue to familiar location

### Edge Cases

- [ ] When a vampire retreats it should not retreat adjacent to another hunted player, instead move as many spaces as possible without doing so
- [ ] Rocks can be thrown out of car, but not thrown into it
  - [ ] If a rock is thrown at the car, it (and the noise token) are placed adjacent, no one in the car is harmed
