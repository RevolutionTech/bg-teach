# Formula D

### Overview

- [ ] Theme & vibe
- [ ] Objective: be first to cross the finish line, don't destroy car
- [ ] Game end: all cars cross finish line or eliminated
- [ ] Gears: determine which die you roll (and how far you move)

### Turn

- [ ] Turn order in order of track position
  - [ ] Tiebreaker: higher gear, closer to inside of track
- [ ] Turn overview: shift gear, roll and move
- [ ] Shift gear: may shift up 1, may shift down 1-3
  - [ ] If skipping gears shifting down, lose WPs

### Movement

- [ ] Cannot drive in the same space as other cars, cannot drive backwards
- [ ] Corners indicated by red-white markings, other regions are considered straights
- [ ] Arrows in corners show valid lane changes
- [ ] Must stop indicated number of times in a corner
  - [ ] Green = longest path, Red = shortest path
  - [ ] You overshoot a corner if you miss one of the stops, lose WPs for spaces overshot
  - [ ] You're eliminated if you miss 2+ of the stops
  - [ ] If you overshoot and stop in a later corner, that stop doesn't count for the later corner
- [ ] Must use fewest number of spaces possible when on a straight
  - [ ] For example, cannot zigzag unnecessarily

### Wear Points (WPs)

- [ ] Start with 18 WPs
- [ ] Skipping gears: lose WPs for each gear skipped when shifting down
- [ ] Overshooting corners: lose WPs when overshooting, 1 per space overshot
  - [ ] Eliminated completely if miss 2+ stops
- [ ] Braking: spend 1 WP per space not moved
  - [ ] Must brake if movement is blocked
- [ ] Collision risk: roll black die when ending move next to another car
  - [ ] Additionally, if an opponent ends movement next to you, roll the black die
  - [ ] On 1-4, lose 1 WP
- [ ] Motor damage: roll black die when rolling max speed in gears 5-6
  - [ ] On 1-4, lose 1 WP
- [ ] If hit 0 WPs, player is eliminated

### Setup

- [ ] All players roll black die to determine start order
  - [ ] Tied players roll again
- [ ] First turn: all players roll the black die to determine initial movement
  - [ ] 1: no movement
  - [ ] 2-16: roll first gear and move
  - [ ] 17+: move 4
